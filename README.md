# Autonomous Line Follower & Maze Solver Robot

An **autonomous robotics project** that combines **PID-based line following** with **maze exploration and shortest-path solving**.
The robot is designed to compete in **line maze solving competitions** where the robot must first **map the maze** and then execute the **fastest optimized path**.

The robot uses **Arduino Nano, an 8-sensor IR array, TB6612FNG motor driver, and N20 metal gear motors**.

---

# Features

* PID-controlled high-speed line following
* Junction detection (T, cross, dead-end)
* Autonomous maze exploration
* Path recording during exploration
* Shortest-path optimization
* Final run using optimized route
* LCD status display
* Modular firmware architecture

---

# Competition Objective

The robot is designed for a **two-stage robotics competition**:

### Day 1 — Qualifier Track

Robot must follow a **black line on a white background** which may include:

* curves
* S-bends
* 90° turns
* small line gaps
* straight sections

Top teams qualify for Day 2.

---

### Day 2 — Maze Solver

The robot performs two phases:

#### Phase 1 — Mapping Run

Robot explores the maze and records decisions.

#### Phase 2 — Final Run

Robot executes the **shortest path discovered during mapping**.

Maze may contain:

* T junctions
* dead ends
* loops
* intersections
* multiple branches

# Software Architecture

The firmware is divided into three major functional stages:

```
1. Line Following
2. Maze Exploration
3. Maze Solving
```

Each module is implemented separately for modular development.

---

# PID Line Following

The robot uses a **PID control system** to maintain alignment with the line.

PID components:

```
P → Proportional correction
I → accumulated error correction
D → future error prediction
```

Correction formula:

```
correction = P * error
           + I * total_error
           + D * (error - previous_error)
```

Motor speeds are adjusted accordingly.

---

# Maze Exploration Algorithm

During exploration the robot follows a decision priority rule:

```
Left → Straight → Right → Backtrack
```

Each decision is stored in a path array:

```
L = Left
S = Straight
R = Right
B = Back
```

Example recorded path:

```
L S R S L B
```

---

# Path Optimization

Dead-end loops are simplified using path compression rules.

Example:

```
L B R → S
L B S → R
R B L → S
```

After optimization:

```
L S R S L B
→
S S R
```

The optimized path is executed during the final run.
